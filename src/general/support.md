It is your responsibility to understand where you can go for support in your role. 

There are many resources available including in this Help Centre. These resources should be made available to relevant staff within your PHN. Please see the following sections available through the left hand navigation pane on this site
- Resources / Training Resources
- Engagement with practices
- User guides


Please ask if you are unsure either through your line manager, your regional coordinator, Population Health  team or your more experienced peers.
