# Each PHN governs it's own data and information
For  the components your PHN has licensed, 
your nominated staff are provided with administration access for your PHN, this gives you total control to

- manage the connection of the PHN Exchange to your general practice extracted data base
- input and manage your own specific data where required
- manage your licensing agreements (EULAs, data sharing, consent) to relevant external parties 

# Automated features
Once your administrator has connected the PHN Exchange to your general practice extracted data base, 
the PHN Exchange automatically;

- creates individual practice areas within the PHN Exchange
- populates information about practices in the practice profile
- configures to generate individual practice reports
- uses the same login and password as the PATCAT system
- presents a general practice report to each individual practice when they login to the system
- only allows a practice to view their own data 
- automatically aggregates and averages all practices using the PHN Exchange to provide benchmarking
- automatic PIP QI dashboarding for PHN administrators

The ABS Atlas is a mapping system linked live to the Australian Bureau of Statistics data sets
- the ABS atlas automatically displays the latest information available
- information is available by region, PHN, LGA SA1/2/3 as ABS statistical areas 

PHN Exchange developer staff will assist in automating as many data feeds as possible. However in many cases, the external custodians  of these data sets do not provide interfaces allowing automation.  Currently in Victoria is is possible to automatically update information for mthe Victorian Health Information Surveillance System (VHISS).
