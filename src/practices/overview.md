# General Practice Overview

General Practices have access to several features within the PHN Exchange that have been organised into a dashboard named the **GP Hub**.

The **GP Hub** also contains helpful information to assist a practice in data quality such as their last data extract date and the last time they have reviewed their Practice Profile.

### GP Hub Features

- **[Practice Profile](/practices/profile)**  
    Maintain and organise your practice information.
- **[Data Report](/practices/data-report)**  
    Customised reporting and benchmarking for your practice data.
- **[Licensing and Agreements](/practices/licensing-agreements)**  
    Electronic licenses agreements between your practice and your PHN.
- **Resources** - *not yet available*  
    Resources specific to your practice provided by your PHN.
